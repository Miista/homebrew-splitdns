// every remote target from this machine: the host key must already be in
// known_hosts. deploy sshes with BatchMode=yes, which cannot answer the
// interactive trust prompt, so an unknown host key fails deploy outright.
// Checked with `ssh-keygen -F` against both the host's ip and its ssh
// destination (either satisfies ssh's lookup); -F understands hashed entries
// where a grep would not.
//
// This check never connects — doctor stays inside the no-SSH boundary
// (design §12; deploy is the ONE exception, and its phase-0 probe is where
// "can we actually connect" is verified for real). It is not --fix-able:
// hemma does not own known_hosts, so the recipe is to connect once
// interactively, so a human sees and accepts the fingerprint (deliberately
// NOT ssh-keyscan, which would trust whatever key is on the wire unseen).
//
// The target set mirrors deploy's default (every host with a role); self is
// skipped (deploy runs locally there, no ssh). Returns the number of hosts
// missing a known_hosts entry.
